CHAPTER 4 - HIVE TABLES DDL
------------------------------------------------------------

- Schema-On-Read

    - The versatility and power of Hadoop lies in its ability to store and process any kind of 
        unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.  Hive allows users to create a metadata layer
        on top of this data and access it using a SQL interface.


    - Since the underlying data in HDFS can be of any format, Hive lets you provide additional 
        information in the metadata to explain exactly the nature in which the data stored is formatted.
        Most of the Hive CREATE statements provide additional information such as how the underlying
        data is structured, how the records are defined, and how fields are separated.



- Hive Data Model

    - Hive's data model is quite similar to various relational databases.  It consists of a schema of
        tables, columns, rows, and partitions.  These objects are logical units that are defined in the
        metadata layer called the Hive Metastore.  In addition to the common data segments, Hive 
        introduces an additional structure called 'buckets'.


    - The Hive Metastore consists of namespaces, object definitions, and the details of the underlying
        data.  As of today, a Hive Metastore is created in an RDBMS, as it is quite critical to have
        fast access to this information.  



- Schemas

    - A Hive schema (or database) is essentially a namespace that holds metadata information for a set
        of tables.  'Schema' and 'database' are synonyms in terms of Hive.  At the filesystem level, it
        is a directory under which all internal tables that belong to the namespace are stored.  Hive
        also has a concept of external tables in which the files might exist in other locations in 
        HDFS.


    - All the data managed by Hive gets stored under a top-level directory defined using the 
        'hive.metastore.warehouse.dir' parameter in the 'hive-site.xml' file.  When you install Hive for
        the first time, it creates a default database called 'default', which itself does not have its
        own directory.  All the internal tables created in the default database are stored under the
        top-level directory in their respective subdirectories.


    - Prior to the addition of the concept of databases in Hive, all user objects were created in a 
        single namespace.  Creating multiple schemas allows users to create objects in different
        namespaces.  So, it allows for logical grouping of various objects.  You can also assign different
        properties (ie different owners, permissions, and warehouse directories) for different databases.
