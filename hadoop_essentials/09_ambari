CHAPTER 9 - AMBARI
------------------------------------------------------------

- Apache Ambari

    - Managing a Hadoop installation by hand can be tedious and time-consuming.  In addition to keeping
        configuration files synchronized across a cluster, starting, stopping, and restarting Hadoop
        services and dependent services in the right order is not a simple task.  The Apache Ambari
        tool is designed to help you easily manage these and other Hadoop administrative issues.


    - In order to use Ambari as a management tool, the entire installation process must be done using
        Ambari.  It is not possible to use Ambari for Hadoop clusters that have been installed by
        other means.  



- Quick Tour of Ambari

    - Ambari is usually available on port 8080

        http://localhost:8080


    - 'Nagios' and 'Ganglia' are 2 of the standard cluster management services installed by Ambari.
        'Nagios' provides cluster monitoring and 'Ganglia' provides cluster metrics.


    - The 'Dashboard' view provides a number of high-level metrics for many of the installed services.
        A glance at the dashboard should allow you to get a sense of how the cluster is performing.


    - The 'Services' menu provides a detailed look at each service running on the cluster.  It also
        provides a graphical method for configuring each service, rather than hand-editing the XML
        files.  The XML files should not be edited by hand if Ambari is being used.


    - If a service provides its own graphical interface (ie HDFS, YARN, Oozie), then that interface can
        be opened in a separate browser tab by using the 'Quick Links' pull-down menu located in the 
        top middle of the window.


    - The 'Service Action' pull-down menu in the upper-left corner provides a method for starting and
        stopping each service and/or its component daemons across the cluster.  Some services may have
        a unique set of actions (ie rebalancing HDFS) that only apply to certain situations.  

      Finally, each service has a 'Service Check' option to make sure the service is working properly.  
        The service check is initally run as part of the installation process and can be valuable when
        diagnosing problems.


    - The 'Hosts View' provides information such as the hostname, IP address, number of cores, memory,
        disk usage, current load average, and Hadoop components on each host.  New hosts can also be
        added by using the 'Actions' pull-down menu.  


    - The 'Admin View' has 3 options:

        1. The 'Repositories' option displays a list of installed software and its versions.

        2. The 'Service Accounts' option lists the service accounts added when the system was installed.
             These accounts are used to run various services and tests for Ambari.

        3. The 'Security' option sets the security on the cluster.


    - The 'Views View' shows the Ambari Views, which is a framework offering a systematic way to plug
        in user interface capabilities that provide for custom visualization, management, and
        monitoring features in Ambari.  Views allow you to extend and customize Ambari to mee your 
        specific needs.


    - The 'Admin' pull-down menu provides the following options:

        - About — Provides the current version of Ambari.

        - Manage Ambari — Open the management screen where Users, Groups, Permissions, and Ambari Views 
            can be created and configured.

        - Settings — Provides the option to turn off the progress window.

        - Sign Out — Exits the interface.
