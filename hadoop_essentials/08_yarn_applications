CHAPTER 8 - YARN APPLICATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

- The YARN Distributed-Shell

    - The YARN Project includes the 'Distributed-Shell' application, which is an example of
        a Hadoop non-MapReduce application built on top of YARN.  Distributed-Shell is a simple
        mechanism for running shell commands and scripts in containers on multiple nodes in a
        Hadoop cluster.


    - The Distributed-Shell is not meant to be a production administration tool, but rather a 
        demonstration of the non-MapReduce capability that can be built on top of YARN.  There are 
        multiple mature implementations of a distributed shell that administrators typically use to 
        manage a cluster of machines.


    - The Distributed-Shell can be used as a starting point for exploring and building YARN
        applications.



- Using the YARN Distributed-Shell

    # Assume and assign the HDP installation path
    $ export YARN_DS=/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-yarn-client/hadoop-yarn-applications-


    # Get options supported by Distributed-Shell
    $ yarn org.apache.hadoop.yarn.applications.distributedshell.Client -jar $YARN_DS -help


    # Run the simple 'uptime' command
    $ yarn org.apache.hadoop.yarn.applications.distributedshell.Client -jar $YARN_DS \
         -shell_command uptime


    Now we want to examine the output for the application.  Distributed-Shell redirects the output of
      the individual shell commands run on the cluster nodes into the log files.  Assuming log 
      aggregation is enabled, the results for each instance of the command can be found by using
      the 'yarn logs' command.


    # Examine results from uptime command
    $ yarn logs -applicationId application_1432831236474_0001
