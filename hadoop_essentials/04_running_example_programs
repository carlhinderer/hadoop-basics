CHAPTER 4 - RUNNING EXAMPLE PROGRAMS
------------------------------------------------------------

- Running MapReduce Examples

    - All Hadoop releases come with MapReduce example applications.  Often, they are under
        '/opt/', but sometimes they are in other directories.  

        # Maybe theyre in /opt
        $ ls /opt/hadoop-2.6.0/share/hadoop/mapreduce/


        # Find the mapreduce examples
        $ find / -name "hadoop-mapreduce-examples*.jar" -print


    - In our sample environment (HDP 2.2 with Hadoop 2.6), the location of the examples is
        '/usr/hdp/2.2.4.2-2/hadoop-mapreduce'.  For the purposes of this example, we'll define
        an environment variable to make it easier.

        # Define environment variable for mapreduce examples
        $ export HADOOP_EXAMPLES=/usr/hdp/2.2.4.2-2/hadoop-mapreduce


    - To list the available examples, we can use the following command.  For our example, we will
        run the 'pi' and 'terasort' examples.

        # List example mapreduce applications
        $ yarn jar $HADOOP_EXAMPLES/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar


    - To run the 'PI' example, we can use the following command.  

        # Run the pi example
        $ yarn jar $HADOOP_EXAMPLES/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar pi 16 1000000



- Using the Web GUI to Monitor Examples

    - We can use the YARN ResourceManager web GUI to monitor and find information about YARN jobs.
        A menu on the left provides navigation to the nodes table, various job categories, and the
        Capacity Scheduler.  


    - This interface can be opened directly from the Ambari YARN service 'Quick Links' menu or
        by navigating to http://hostname:8088.
