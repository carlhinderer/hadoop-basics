Apache Hadoop and Spark Fundamentals (Third Edition)

LESSON 3.2 USE HDFS COMMAND LINE TOOLS


# To interact with HDFS, the hdfs command must be used. 
# HDFS provides a series of commands similar to those found in a standar Unix/Linux
# file system, excpet they must be prefaced with "hdfs dfs"

List Files in HDFS
------------------

# To list the files in the root HDFS directory enter the following:

$ hdfs dfs -ls /
Found 8 items
drwxr-xr-x  - hdfs  hdfs   0 2013-02-06 21:17 /apps
drwxr-xr-x  - hdfs  hadoop   0 2014-01-01 14:17 /benchmarks

drwxr-xr-x  - hdfs  hdfs   0 2013-12-17 12:57 /system
drwxrwxr--  - hdfs  hadoop   0 2013-11-21 14:07 /tmp
drwxrwxr-x  - hdfs  hadoop   0 2013-10-31 11:13 /user
drwxr-xr-x  - doug  hdfs   0 2013-10-11 16:24 /usr
drwxr-xr-x  - hdfs  hdfs   0 2013-10-31 21:25 /yarn

# To list files in your home directory in HDFS enter the following:

$ hdfs dfs –ls

# The same result can be obtained by issuing a:

$ hdfs dfs -ls /user/doug

 Make a Directory in HDFS
-------------------------
# To make a directory in HDFS use the following command. As with the –ls command, when no path is supplied the users home directory is used.   (i.e. /users/doug)

$ hdfs dfs -mkdir stuff

Copy Files to HDFS
------------------

# To copy a file from your current local directory into HDFS use the following. Note again, that the absence 
# of a full path assumes your home directory. In this case the file test is placed in the directory stuff, 
# which was created above. 

$ hdfs dfs -put test stuff

# The file transfer can be confirmed by using the –ls command:

$ hdfs dfs -ls stuff
  
Found 1 items
-rw-r--r--  3 doug hadoop   0 2014-01-03 17:03 stuff/test

Copy Files from HDFS
--------------------

# Files can be copied back to your local file system using the following. In this case, the file we copied into HDFS, 
# test, will be copied back to the current local directory with the name test-local.

$ hdfs dfs -get stuff/test test-local

Copy Files within HDFS
----------------------

# The following will copy a file in HDFS.

$ hdfs dfs -cp stuff/test test.hdfs

Delete a File within HDFS
-------------------------

# The following will delete the HDFS file test.dhfs that was created above. 
# Note, if the "-skipTrash" argument is not provided, a message indicating
# that the file has been moved to your .Trash directory will be printed. 

$ hdfs dfs -rm -skipTrash test.hdfs
  
Deleted test.hdfs

Delete a Directory in HDFS
--------------------------

# The following will delete the HDFS directory stuff and all its contents. 

$ hdfs dfs -rm -r stuff
  
Deleted stuff
