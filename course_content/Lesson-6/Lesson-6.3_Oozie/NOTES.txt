Apache Hadoop and Spark Fundamentals (Third Edition)

LESSON 6.3 APACHE OOZIE 

OS: Linux
Platform: RHEL 6.3
Hadoop Version: 2.4
Hadoop Version: Hortonworks HDP 2.1
Oozie Version: 4.0.0

Reference:

Step 1: Set hadoop.proxyuser.oozie.groups in core-site.xml
==========================================================
# This step depends on the group that will be running
# Oozie. The default is "users." We are going to run 
# Oozie as group "hadoop" so there is a change needed
# in the core-site.xml file.

# If using Ambari, go to Services/HDFS/Config tab and at the bottom
# click on  Custom core-site.xml. Change "hadoop.proxyuser.oozie.groups"
# from "users" to "hadoop."

# Note: You may wish to change this for faclon, hcat, and hive as well.
# If you plan on keeping placing users in group "users" this is not needed.

# If not using Ambari, set this directly in core-site.xml and restart Hadoop.

<property>
      <name>hadoop.proxyuser.oozie.groups</name>
      <value>hadoop</value>
</property>


Step 2: Download Oozie Examples
===============================
# The examples are part of the oozie-client-4.0.0.2.1.2.1-471.el6.noarch.rpm
# package. Make sure this is installed, then as user hdfs,

  tar xvzf /usr/share/doc/oozie-4.0.0.2.1.2.1/oozie-examples.tar.gz

# the examples must also be placed in HDFS

  hdfs dfs -put examples/ examples

# The the Oozie Share Library must be installed in HDFS.
# If you are using the Ambari install of HDP 2.1 from lesson 8.6, this is 
# already in HDFS under: /user/oozie/share/lib. It is part of the 
# oozie-4.0.0.2.1.2.1-471.el6.noarch.rpm and is installed on the host in 
# /usr/lib/oozie/oozie-sharelib.tar.gz. If you install by hand, then 
# make /user/oozie in HDFS and put the extracted oozie-sharelib files
# in this directory as user oozie and group hadoop.

# The example applications are under the examples/app directory, one directory per example. 
# The directory contains the application XML file (workflow, or worklfow and coordinator), 
# the job.properties file to submit the job and any JAR files the example may need.

# The inputs for all examples are in the examples/input-data/ directory.
# The examples create output under the examples/output-data/${EXAMPLE_NAME} directory.



Step 3: Run The Simple MapReduce Example
========================================
# job.properties - defined values (path names, ports, etc) for a jobs
# workflow.xml - workflow for the job. In this case, simple MR (pass/fail)

# view the workflow.xml

  vi examples/apps/map-reduce/workflow.xml

# update local job.properties to reflect current system.
# Important: This must be done for all the examples.

   vi examples/apps/map-reduce/job.properties

# change 

   nameNode=hdfs://localhost:8020
   jobTracker=localhost:8032

# to

   nameNode=hdfs://limulus:8020
   jobTracker=limulus:8050

# Note the change in port number for the jobTracker line.

# Run the job

oozie job -run -oozie http://limulus:11000/oozie -config examples/apps/map-reduce/job.properties

# To avoid having to provide the -oozie option with the Oozie URL with every oozie command, 
# set OOZIE_URL env variable to the Oozie URL in the shell environment. For example:

   export OOZIE_URL="http://limulus:11000/oozie"

# Then the command is (it then prints the job id number):

   oozie job  -config examples/apps/map-reduce/job.properties -run
   job: 0000005-140824145757925-oozie-oozi-W

   oozie job  -info job: 0000005-140824145757925-oozie-oozi-W

# Use the Oozie web console to view job progress and flow.

   http://limulus:11000/oozie/



Step 4: Run the Oozie Demo Application
======================================
# A more sophisticated example can be found in the demo directory:
# View the workflow.xml

   vi examples/apps/demo/workflow.xml 

# Don't forget to change examples/apps/demo/job.properties (see above)
# To run

  oozie job -run   -config examples/apps/demo/job.properties




# Short Summary of Oozie job Commands
=====================================

1) Run Job:

   oozie job -run  -config JOB_PROPERITES

2) Submit job:

   oozie job -config JOB_PROPERTIES -submit job: OOZIE_JOB_ID
 
3) Run job:

   oozie job  -start OOZIE_JOB_ID
 
4) Check the status:

   oozie job  -info OOZIE_JOB_ID
 
5) Suspend workflow:

   oozie job  -suspend OOZIE_JOB_ID
 
6) Resume workflow:

   oozie job  -resume OOZIE_JOB_ID
 
7) Re-run workflow:

   oozie job  -config JOB_PROPERTIES -rerun OOZIE_JOB_ID
 
8) Should you need to kill the job:

   oozie job  -kill OOZIE_JOB_ID
 
9) View server logs:

   oozie job  -logs OOZIE_JOB_ID
 
# Full Logs are available at:

   /var/log/oozie on the Oozie server.
